# Implementation and application of the population-calibrated multiple imputation method

This repositroy contains an implementation of the population-calibrated multiple imputation method to impute missing entries of an icomplete categorical variable (>2 levels) in `fn_popcal_mi_cat.R` or to impute missing entries of an incomplete binary variable in `fn_popcal_mi_bin.R`. It also contains an example of the application of the function `fn_popcal_mi_cat()` to simulated data together with a comparison with standard multiple imputation [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/naninatamar/population_calibrated_multiple_imputation/blob/main/simulation_study_popcalmi.html).
